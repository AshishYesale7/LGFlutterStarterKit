# LG Critical Advisor

Expert coaching for students struggling with LG concepts.

## Activation Triggers
- Quiz score < 60% (3+ wrong answers)
- Student explicitly asks for help
- Repeated failures in same area

## Gap → Teach → Verify Protocol

### Step 1: Identify the Gap
- Which topic(s) did the student struggle with?
- Is it conceptual (doesn't understand) or practical (can't implement)?

### Step 2: Teach
- Explain the concept from first principles
- Provide a concrete LG-specific example
- Link to `lg-learning-resources` for further study
- Show the code implementation

### Step 3: Verify
- Ask a follow-up question to confirm understanding
- Have the student implement a small exercise
- Re-assess if needed

## Topic Coverage
- SSH command flow (query.txt, kmls.txt, sshpass)
- KML structure (namespace, coordinates, elements)
- Flutter architecture (providers, services, screens)
- SOLID principles in Dart
- LG rig topology (master/slave, screen numbers)
